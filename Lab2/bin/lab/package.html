The package contains the code for studying the Factory, Builder, and Prototype creational patterns.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In this lab, a number of walls, doors, and rooms are combined into a stable using three different creational design patterns.
The class that represents the stable is called <code>Stable</code>.
The stable is composed of a number of rooms, and each room is composed of four sides of different types/classes.
Each side class is a subclass of <code>MapSite</code>; please refer to GoF.
</p>
<p>
The constructor to a room takes two coordinates, x and y, and the constructor of a wall takes a direction inside a room.
The constructor of a door takes two rooms and places itself between them.
</p>
<p>
Be careful when you construct the stable: the last added side in a direction in a room replaces the old side in that direction in that room.
You can create different stables for different creational design patterns studied in this lab.
Alternatively, you can use only one layout for all the patterns.
In either way, your stable is required to have:
</p>
<ol>
<li>two ordinary rooms with at least one door,
<li>five horseboxes with one boxdoor each,
<li>three rooms in a row that work like a corridor, and
<li>walls along the perimeter.
</ol>

<p>
The Eclipse project for this lab can be set up in the same way as it was <a href="https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDB84/labs/lab1/doc/" target="blank">described</a> with respect to the first lab.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the menu of the applet to switch between different construction methods.
<li>Press the letter 'h' to add a horse into the stable.
<li>Use the arrow keys to control the person represented by a helmet in the stable.
<li>Press the enter key to open the door that is in front of the person.
</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
By creating the stable using different creational patterns, you observe the strengths and weaknesses of these patterns, and, in the future, you will be able to choose the one that fits best in a given situation.
</p>

<h2>Section A</h2>
<h3>Readings</h3>
<p>
The introduction to creational design patterns in GoF on p. 81&ndash;85, the Factory Method pattern starting from p. 107, and the lectures.
</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
Create a stable according to the requirements given earlier using the Factory Method pattern.
</p>

<p>
Write the body of the <code>factoryConstruction</code> method in <code>StablePanel</code> and create one or two your own classes.
</p>

<h3>Hints</h3>
<p>
Look at <code>defaultConstruction</code> in <code>StablePanel</code> to see how the classes representing various parts of a stable are utilized there.
</p>

<h2>Section B</h2>
<h3>Readings</h3>
<p>
The chapter about the Builder pattern in GoF on p. 97&ndash;107.
</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
Create a stable using the Builder pattern.
</p>

<p>
Write the body of the <code>builderConstruction</code> method in <code>StablePanel</code> and create one or two your own classes.
</p>

<h3>Hints</h3>
<p>
<code>Stable</code> is a singleton; adapt your Builder accordingly.
</p>

<h2>Section C</h2>
<h3>Readings</h3>
<p>
The chapter about the Prototype pattern in GoF on p. 117&ndash;126 and the lectures.
</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
Create a stable using the Prototype pattern.
Inspect the requirements on a stable once again and decide on suitable prototypes.
</p>

<p>
Write the body of the <code>builderConstruction</code> method in <code>StablePanel</code> and create the class(es) needed for the Prototype pattern.
</p>

<h3>Hints</h3>
<p>
Think about how and who creates prototypes.
Is a Singleton suitable for storing prototypes?
</p>

<h2>Hand In</h2>
<p>
Apart from explaining the details of your implementation and answering the questions of your lab assistant, you are required to hand in the classes that you have created and those that you have modified.
To this end, provide your code with comments where it is needed, compress all the relevant classes (*.java only) into a single archive, and send this archive to the lab assistant.
